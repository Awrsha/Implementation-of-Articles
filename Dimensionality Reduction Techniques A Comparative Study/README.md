# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques: A Comparative Study

In this task, we aim to implement and compare the effectiveness of various dimensionality reduction techniques, including PCA, ISOMAP, and Variational Autoencoder (VAE), for image classification.

## Data Preparation

We begin by loading the dataset according to the given instructions. If the student ID is even, we load the CIFAR-10 dataset; otherwise, we load the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## ISOMAP and PCA

We conduct research on ISOMAP and PCA and provide summaries of their functionalities, advantages, and disadvantages. We then apply these techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and perform image classification in the reduced space.

## Convolutional and Dense Autoencoders

Next, we create autoencoder architectures using convolutional layers and dense layers separately. We train these autoencoders on the dataset and utilize the encoder part for dimensionality reduction. We report the classification performance using different values of KNN and evaluate the reduced space with a testing set.

## Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

We delve into Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and its latent variable properties. We construct VAE architectures with both convolutional and dense layers and train them on the dataset. Similar to the previous step, we use the encoder part for dimensionality reduction and evaluate classification performance with various KNN values.

## Exploration in Latent Space

We explore the latent space generated by VAE by generating sample images using the decoder network and visualizing the latent space of the training data using scatter plots.

## Diffusion Models

Finally, we compare Diffusion Models with VAEs, examining their functionality and performance for image generation tasks.

This comprehensive study provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different dimensionality reduction techniques and their applicability in image classification and generation tasks.
