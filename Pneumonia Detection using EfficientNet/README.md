# Pneumonia Detection using EfficientNet

## Introduction

Pneumonia is a deadly infectious disease that causes respiratory disorders and requires thorough examination of chest X-ray images for diagnosis. This process typically requires a skilled radiologist and can be challenging even for trained professionals due to the ambiguous appearance of pneumonia in X-rays. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become a popular machine learning algorithm for learning to diagnose diseases from images, and they can also be used to detect pneumonia. In this exercise, we will use EfficientNet to classify chest X-ray images into two categories: Pneumonia and Normal.

## Data Preparation and Preprocessing

### Dataset

The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). It contains chest X-ray images categorized into two classes: Pneumonia and Normal. The dataset will be split as follows:
- 60% for training
- 20% for validation
- 20% for testing

### Preprocessing and Data Augmentation

Due to the limited number of samples in this dataset, data augmentation techniques are essential to increase the dataset size and improve the model's performance. The following preprocessing and data augmentation techniques are typically used:

- **Resizing**: Adjust the images to a uniform size.
- **Normalization**: Scale the pixel values to a range of 0 to 1.
- **Data Augmentation**: Apply transformations such as rotations, translations, flips, and zooms to artificially increase the diversity of the training dataset.

## EfficientNet Architecture

### Layers

EfficientNet is known for its balance between model depth, width, and resolution. It is built upon the following key layers:

1. **Conv2D Layers**: Extract features from the input images.
2. **Batch Normalization**: Normalize the outputs of previous layers.
3. **Activation Layers (Swish)**: Introduce non-linearity.
4. **Depthwise Separable Convolutions**: Reduce computational complexity.
5. **MBConv Blocks**: Mobile Inverted Bottleneck Convolution blocks that balance model complexity and performance.
6. **Global Average Pooling**: Reduce each feature map to a single value.
7. **Fully Connected Layer**: Combine the features and pass to the output layer.
8. **Dropout**: Prevent overfitting.
9. **Output Layer (Softmax)**: Provide the probability distribution over the classes.

### Rationale

EfficientNet is chosen for its scalable and efficient architecture that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer parameters and computations compared to traditional CNNs.

- **Confusion Matrix**: Provide insights into the model's classification performance for each class.

### Interpretation

Interpret the results by comparing the achieved accuracy with other CNN architectures and discussing the efficiency in terms of computational resources and training time.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates that EfficientNet can achieve high accuracy in pneumonia detection with significantly fewer parameters and computational requirements compared to traditional deep CNNs. The proposed architecture is particularly useful for applications with limited resources.

## Future Work

Further research can explore the optimization of hyperparameters and the addition of regularization techniques to enhance the model's performance.
