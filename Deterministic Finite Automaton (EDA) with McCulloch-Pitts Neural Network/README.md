## Deterministic Finite Automaton (EDA) with McCulloch-Pitts Neural Network

This project involves understanding a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) and designing a neural network to simulate it. The DFA can detect specific patterns in inputs and will output a signal when the pattern is recognized. The DFA described here has three states and operates on the binary alphabet {0, 1}. The project involves the following steps:

1. **Defining and Analyzing the DFA**:
   - Understanding the state transition diagram of the DFA.
   - Creating the state transition table.
   
2. **Designing Neural Networks**:
   - Designing three separate neural networks to represent the DFA.
   - Each network corresponds to a specific output (current state, next state, acceptance state).
   - Optimizing the networks to have the minimum number of neurons and thresholds.
   
3. **Integrating the Networks**:
   - Combining the three neural networks into a single, optimized network.
   
4. **Implementing and Testing**:
   - Implementing the neural network in Python.
   - Testing the network with various inputs to verify its functionality.

## 1. Defining and Analyzing the DFA

### DFA Description

The DFA operates on binary inputs and recognizes a specific pattern. The state transition diagram and state transition table for the DFA are given below:

**State Transition Diagram**:
- State 0: Start state.
- State 1: Intermediate state.
- State 2: Intermediate state.
- State 3: Acceptance state (double circle indicates acceptance).

**Example**: For the input `011001`:
- Start in state 0.
- Transition to state 1 on reading the first `0`.
- Stay in state 1 on reading the next `1`.
- Transition to state 2 on reading the next `1`.
- Transition to state 3 on reading the next `0`.
- Stay in state 3 on reading the next `0`.
- Stay in state 3 on reading the last `1`.

### State Transition Table

| Current State | Input | Next State | Acceptance |
|---------------|-------|------------|------------|
| 0             | 0     | 0          | 0          |
| 0             | 1     | 1          | 0          |
| 1             | 0     | 2          | 0          |
| 1             | 1     | 1          | 0          |
| 2             | 0     | 3          | 1          |
| 2             | 1     | 1          | 0          |
| 3             | 0     | 3          | 1          |
| 3             | 1     | 3          | 1          |

## 2. Designing Neural Networks

### Neural Network Design

Three separate neural networks will be designed for the following outputs:
1. Current state.
2. Next state.
3. Acceptance state.

#### Design Considerations

- Each network should have the minimum number of neurons.
- Threshold values should be optimized.
- Each network should be represented as a separate diagram.

### Output 1: Current State

#### Network Design
- Input neurons: Represent the current state and input.
- Output neurons: Represent the current state in binary form.

### Output 2: Next State

#### Network Design
- Input neurons: Represent the current state and input.
- Output neurons: Represent the next state in binary form.

### Output 3: Acceptance State

#### Network Design
- Input neurons: Represent the current state and input.
- Output neurons: Indicate whether the state is accepting (1) or not (0).

## 3. Integrating the Networks

### Combined Network Design

- Integrate the three separate networks into a single neural network.
- Optimize to have the minimum number of neurons and thresholds.
- Ensure that the combined network provides all three outputs correctly.

## 4. Implementing and Testing

### Implementation in Python

- Implement the combined neural network in Python.
- Simulate the DFA using the neural network.
- Test the network with various inputs to verify correct state transitions and pattern recognition.

### Testing

- Test the neural network with all possible input sequences.
- Ensure the network transitions through states correctly and identifies acceptance states accurately.

## Conclusion
