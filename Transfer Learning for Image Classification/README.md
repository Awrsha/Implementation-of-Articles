# Transfer Learning for Image Classification

## Introduction

The purpose of this exercise is to familiarize with transfer learning techniques. Each group is assigned a specific paper and dataset based on the sum of the last digits of the group members' student IDs, modulo 4. This guide outlines the steps for selecting the appropriate model, preparing the dataset, implementing the architecture, and evaluating the performance.

## Dataset and Model Selection

### Model and Dataset Table

| Remainder | Model      | Dataset URL |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| 0         | ResNet50   | [COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset) |
| 1         | GoogLeNet  | [Fruit Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshikamaru/fruit-recognition) |
| 2         | VGG-16     | [EuroSAT Dataset](https://github.com/phelber/EuroSAT) |
| 3         | Inception  | [Brain Tumor Dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427) |

### Example

If the last digits of the student IDs are 4 and 2, their sum is 6. 6 % 4 = 2, so the group will work with VGG-16 and the EuroSAT dataset.

## Report on Assigned Paper

### Understanding Transfer Learning

Transfer learning involves leveraging a pre-trained model on a large dataset and fine-tuning it for a specific task on a different dataset. This approach can significantly reduce the time and computational resources needed for training.

### Architecture Explanation

Each assigned model has a unique architecture:
- **ResNet50**: Utilizes residual learning to ease the training of deep networks by learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs.
- **GoogLeNet**: Employs Inception modules that allow for more efficient computation and deeper networks by concatenating filters of different sizes.
- **VGG-16**: Consists of 16 layers with small (3x3) convolution filters, known for its simplicity and depth.
- **Inception**: Similar to GoogLeNet, with deeper and wider Inception modules for efficient computation.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**ResNet50**:
- **Advantages**: Mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, easy to optimize.
- **Disadvantages**: High computational cost, large memory requirements.

**GoogLeNet**:
- **Advantages**: Efficient computation, fewer parameters compared to similarly performing models.
- **Disadvantages**: Complex architecture, harder to implement.

**VGG-16**:
- **Advantages**: Simple and uniform architecture, good for transfer learning.
- **Disadvantages**: High computational cost, large model size.

**Inception**:
- **Advantages**: Efficient, good performance with fewer parameters.
- **Disadvantages**: Complex architecture, challenging to implement and optimize.

### Preprocessing

Preprocessing steps depend on the specific dataset but generally include:
- **Resizing**: Adjust images to a uniform size (e.g., 224x224).
- **Normalization**: Scale pixel values to a range of 0 to 1.
- **Data Augmentation**: Apply transformations such as rotations, flips, and zooms to increase dataset variability.

## Model Implementation

### Network Capabilities

Each network is designed to handle specific types of images. If an image outside the trained categories is provided, the network might misclassify it. Possible solutions include retraining with additional data or using more generalizable models.

### Dataset Download and Examination

Download the dataset from the provided link, inspect the images, and ensure they are correctly formatted and labeled.

### Network Implementation and Training

Implement the chosen model, fine-tune it on the given dataset, and train it. Below is an example structure for implementing VGG-16 with the EuroSAT dataset.


### Evaluation

Evaluate the model on the test set and plot the accuracy and loss curves. Calculate and report the precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Conclusion

This exercise demonstrates the process of implementing transfer learning using a pre-trained model for image classification. By following the steps outlined, one can achieve high accuracy even with limited data, showcasing the power and efficiency of transfer learning.
