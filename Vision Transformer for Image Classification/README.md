# Vision Transformer for Image Classification

In this task, we explore the use of transformers in computer vision and delve into relevant research articles.

## Understanding Image Transformers

Recent advancements in computer vision have seen an increase in the adoption of transformer-based architectures, surpassing the performance of traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While these architectures offer superior performance, they come with significantly higher computational costs, especially during training. As these models are relatively new in the field of computer vision, there is a need to study their transfer learning capabilities and fine-tuning strategies to find the most suitable architecture for real-world applications. 

## Distillation Techniques

One approach to mitigate the limitations of using large transformer models is model distillation. Distillation involves training smaller models to mimic the behavior of larger, pre-trained models. One such approach is the Distillation by Fine-Tuning method, as proposed in the article "Investigating Transfer Learning Capabilities of Vision Transformers and CNNs by Fine-Tuning a Single Trainable Block". This method fine-tunes only the last block of the transformer model, resulting in a smaller, yet efficient, model.

## Implementation and Evaluation

### Data Preparation
To implement the research article, we first load the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing steps. We use the CIFAR-10 dataset and preprocess it according to the procedures outlined in the article.

### Convolutional Network Fine-Tuning
We select a fully convolutional model and fine-tune it on the CIFAR-10 dataset by unfreezing the specified layers. We report the validation loss and accuracy of the model after fine-tuning.

### Vision Transformer Fine-Tuning
Similarly, we select one of the fully transformer-based models mentioned in the article and fine-tune it on the CIFAR-10 dataset by unfreezing the specified layers. We utilize the Hugging Face library for fine-tuning the vision transformer model. Again, we report the validation performance metrics.

## Conclusion

This task provides hands-on experience in implementing and evaluating vision transformer models for image classification tasks. By following the steps outlined above, we gain insights into the capabilities and limitations of transformer-based architectures in computer vision applications.
