### Pneumonia Detection using EfficientNet

- **Descriptoin :**
  - Pneumonia is a deadly infectious disease that causes respiratory disorders and requires thorough examination of chest X-ray images for diagnosis. This process typically requires a skilled radiologist and can be challenging even for trained professionals due to the ambiguous appearance of pneumonia in X-rays. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become a popular machine learning algorithm for learning to diagnose diseases from images, and they can also be used to detect pneumonia. In this exercise, we will use EfficientNet to classify chest X-ray images into two categories: Pneumonia and Normal.

### Principal Component Analysis

- **Descriptoin :**
  - One of the conventional techniques for dimensionality reduction is PCA or Principal Component Analysis. Usually, it is not possible to work with large data with many dimensions, and we need to remove some dimensions that are not very important, if possible, before processing. In this project, as an example, we have tried to examine the data in the matrix of an image and at the end we have reduced one of the dimensions of the image. 

### Question-Answering System

These systems aim to automatically extract answers from a given text, playing vital roles in various domains such as information retrieval, conversational agents, and virtual assistants.
  - The Extractive QA task involves designing and implementing a system based on transformer models, such as BERT, to extract the best answer from a text given a question. Unlike generative QA systems that generate answers from scratch, extractive QA systems rely on information present in the text.
