# Violence Detection in Videos using Deep Learning

The goal of this exercise is to implement research papers titled:

- **Video Surveillance for Violence Detection Using Deep Learning**

## Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

Download and preprocess the Hockeyfights dataset mentioned in the paper, which consists of videos labeled as "with violence" and "without violence." Extract frames from the videos and preprocess them as described in the paper.

## Model Implementation and Training

Implement the ResNet50 model as specified in the paper for violence detection. Train the model on the preprocessed dataset. Adjust hyperparameters based on the paper's guidelines or choose suitable values for comparison purposes.

## Results and Analysis

Plot precision-recall curves, error curves, and confusion matrices. Calculate metrics such as Recall, Precision, F1 score, and accuracy for the evaluation dataset. Present the results and provide insights into the model's performance.

Note: Detailed line-by-line code explanations are not necessary in the report. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch libraries are permissible for implementation.
