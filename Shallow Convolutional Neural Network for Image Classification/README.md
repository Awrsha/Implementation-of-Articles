# Image Classification with Shallow Convolutional Neural Networks

## Introduction

This project explores the implementation of a shallow convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification. The goal is to achieve high accuracy with fewer layers compared to deep CNNs, which require significant computational resources and long training times. The architecture is tested on three datasets: MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10.

## Data Preparation and Preprocessing

### Datasets

We use three datasets for this project:
1. **MNIST**: Handwritten digits dataset.
2. **Fashion MNIST**: Zalando's article images consisting of 10 fashion categories.
3. **CIFAR-10**: 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

### Preprocessing

#### Normalization

Normalization is a crucial step in preprocessing. It scales the pixel values of images to a range of 0 to 1. This helps the model to converge faster during training. The normalization process involves dividing the pixel values by 255.

## Architecture Description

### Layers

The proposed architecture uses fewer layers compared to traditional deep CNNs. Here is a brief description of the layers used:

1. **Convolutional Layer**: Extracts features from the input image.
2. **Activation Layer (ReLU)**: Introduces non-linearity to the model.
3. **Pooling Layer (MaxPooling)**: Reduces the dimensionality of the feature map.
4. **Fully Connected Layer**: Combines all the features and feeds them to the output layer.
5. **Output Layer (Softmax)**: Provides the probability distribution over the classes.

### Focus of the Architecture

The primary focus of the proposed architecture is the shallow design, which aims to achieve a balance between performance and computational efficiency. The rationale is that a shallower network can reduce training time and resource consumption while maintaining competitive accuracy.

## Implementation

### Model Implementation

The architecture can be implemented using Keras. Below is a pseudocode representation (actual code should be written based on the specific details provided in the paper):

## Results

### Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated on the test sets of each dataset. The accuracy and loss are recorded.

### Visualization

- **Accuracy and Loss Curves**: Plot the accuracy and loss for both training and testing datasets.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provide insights into the model's classification performance for each class.

### Interpretation

Interpret the results by comparing the achieved accuracy with deep CNNs and discussing the efficiency in terms of computational resources and training time.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates that a shallow CNN can achieve competitive accuracy with significantly lower computational requirements. The proposed architecture is particularly useful for applications with limited resources.

## Future Work

Further research can explore the optimization of hyperparameters and the addition of regularization techniques to enhance the model's performance.
