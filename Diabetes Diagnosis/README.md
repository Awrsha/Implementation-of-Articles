# Diabetes Diagnosis with Machine Learning

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook project focuses on diagnosing diabetes using various machine learning algorithms. The project employs k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for diabetes prediction. This README provides an advanced overview of the project, its purpose, and how to use it effectively.

## Project Description

The primary goal of this project is to explore the performance of different machine learning algorithms in diagnosing diabetes. It leverages a dataset containing various health-related features to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not. The algorithms utilized include KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and MLP. Each algorithm is trained, tested, and evaluated to assess its accuracy and effectiveness in diabetes diagnosis.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install jupyter numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains patient information, such as age, BMI, glucose levels, blood pressure, etc., along with a binary label indicating whether the patient has diabetes (1 for diabetes, 0 for no diabetes). Ensure you have the dataset file (e.g., `diabetes.csv`) available in the project directory.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Awrsha/Diabetes-Diagnosis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd diabetes-diagnosis
```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `diabetes-diagnosis.ipynb` notebook in your browser.

## Running the Notebook

Within the Jupyter Notebook, follow the step-by-step instructions to:

- Load and preprocess the diabetes dataset.
- Train and test each machine learning algorithm for diabetes diagnosis.
- Evaluate the performance of each algorithm in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualize the results using various plots and charts.

Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to gain a comprehensive understanding of the project.

## Results

The notebook provides detailed results and analysis of each machine learning algorithm's performance in diagnosing diabetes. You can find accuracy and evaluation metrics for each algorithm, as well as visualizations of the results.
