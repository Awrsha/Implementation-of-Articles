The paper related to this network has been provided as an attachment. You will utilize Faster R-CNN on a new dataset, requiring retraining on this dataset. Obtain the dataset required for training this network from [this link](link_to_dataset). The dataset includes images of humans, bicycles, cars, motorcycles, and airplanes, which are provided in the "Required_Files" attachment. To simplify the implementation of this network, several files are included in the folder. It is recommended to review the contents of these files to understand their functionality. Then:

## Architecture Explanation

- **Faster R-CNN**: 
  - Faster R-CNN is an object detection model that combines a region proposal network (RPN) with a detection network.
  - The RPN proposes regions likely to contain objects, and the detection network classifies these regions and refines their positions.

## Model Training

- **Re-training Pre-trained Model**:
  - Utilize a pre-trained model for Faster R-CNN and re-train it on the provided dataset.
  - PyTorch provides several pre-trained models, including Faster R-CNN.

## Implementation Recommendations

- **Use of Google Colab**:
  - Since training image processing models requires significant computational resources, it is recommended to use Google Colab.
  - Start this exercise early and ensure you have access to adequate computing resources for training.
  - The provided dataset may require approximately five epochs for training to achieve good accuracy.

## Evaluation and Results

- **Output Images**:
  - After training, evaluate the model on the test dataset and generate output images showcasing object detection and counting.
  - The expected output images should resemble the sample provided.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can implement Faster R-CNN for object detection and counting in images. Ensure to utilize the pre-trained model efficiently and re-train it on the provided dataset to achieve accurate results. Finally, evaluate the model's performance and generate output images demonstrating its object detection capabilities.
